Lets Play A Game

[Link to Project website](https://lets-play-some-games.herokuapp.com/)

Complete the three "levels" that currently make up the entirety of the game(I will be adding more when I come across some new interactions I want to practice). Follow the instructions given to you and interact with the DOM elements to progress.

Not currently playable on mobile.

Uses React, TypeScript and Sass/Scss. This project would have been infinitely more difficult to manage game state and updating/re-rendering DOM elements without a frontend framework like React. Typescript was used mainly for reminding me to check for whether DOM elements existed (not null) and keeping track of component Props. The convenience offered by Sass in being able to use nested selectors makes sure I can reuse common class names and not have to worry about things entering the global name space unintentionally.

This was mainly a project to learn and showcase some basic DOM interaction and animations while also learning a bit more about Typescript and some of its exentricities when updating DOM elements. The biggest challenge during this project was the dragging of the box in the second level as I ran into some issues with tracking mouse position as some clicking from the previous level could cause the box to move unexpectedly. Also just dealing with all of the Typescript error messages that were new to me and slowed down development time at the beginning.
